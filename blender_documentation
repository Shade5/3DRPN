1] to run the blender without using gui
../../BLENDER/blender create_data.blend --background --python blender_script.py

2] wrapper.py calls rendering_script.py multiple times to generate images with different configurations
Bugs to fix: there is some wierd error at the end of execution each call of rendering_script.py and it happens during transfer of control between wrapper.py and rendering_script.py[have to fix this]
