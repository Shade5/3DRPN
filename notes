In this branch, the following are modified:




TODO:
- [x] elevation angle: 20, 40, 60
- [x] camera moving order: horizontal (top down ccw) first, vertical (up) second
- [x] remove bbox data generation
- [x] camera fov
- [ ] scene size, obj size, voxel generation
        now use scene size 2, binvox -1 to 1, not really sure
- [x] camera sphere radius: radius is 4
- [x] obj export coordinate axis order
- [ ] check depth map
- [ ] make lighting more complex


=========== notes ===========
1. camera
    focal length, fov are related by sensor size
2. objects are placed on a plane with z = 0 (ricson's data not like this, so compatibility with elevation/azimuth definition needs further checking)
2. depth interpretation:
    7 - 17
    7: 0
    7.1: 25
    7.2: 39
    7.3: 48
    8: 89
    16: 243
    17: 255
